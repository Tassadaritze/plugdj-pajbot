Roulette
=========

Enter the roulette by typing .join in chat and leave it again by typing .leave.

After the roulette ends, the bot randomly picks one of the users who joined and moves them to a random position in waitlist.

Roulettes can be initated by mods only and generally last 60 seconds.


Russian Roulette
=========

Russian roulettes function like normal roulettes, but have a 1/6 chance to instead kick the selected user out of the waitlist.

They are entered and left by typing .rjoin and .rleave respectively.
