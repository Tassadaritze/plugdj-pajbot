Dueling
=========

A duel can be initated if `@user1` types `.duel @user2`, and `@user2` accepts the duel request with `.accept`.

Both users must be above position (waitlist length-5) in the wait list.

The winner will take the losers position if the loser is above the winner in the waitlist, otherwise the winner will get moved 5 spots up.

The loser will be removed from the waitlist. If the loser is currently playing his song, the loser's song will be skipped!
